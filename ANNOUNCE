The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.13.1, is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=====================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

1.2 Noteworthy changes in version `1.13.1'
==========================================

Various minor bugs and MacOS-X incompatibilities fixed.  One important
fix for a possible buffer overrun attack when initialising NSDate
objects from strings.  One fix for a serious (crash) bug when
initialising the bundles system in an application which has a lot of
frameworks linked to it.  See the release notes for more details.

1.3 Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==================================================

The gnustep-base-1.13.1.tar.gz distribution file has been placed at
`ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/core'.
