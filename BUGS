   * NSZone memory allocation doesn't work correctly. Don't try to
     create a zone and alloc memory from it. Always alloc memory from
     the default zone.

   * Invocations (and by extension, Distributed Objects) work well only
     on ix86 platforms. In particular, they don't work well on PPC and
     Sparc platforms.

   * Distributed Objects aren't thread safe. Don't use DO between
     threads in a multi-theaded app.
