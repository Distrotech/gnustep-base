@item NSZone memory allocation doesn't work correctly. Don't try to create
a zone and alloc memory from it. Always alloc memory from the default zone.

@item Invocations (and by extension, Distributed Objects) work well only
on ix86 platforms. In particular, they don't work well on PPC and Sparc
platforms.  

@item Distributed Objects aren't thread safe. Don't use DO
between threads in a multi-theaded app.
